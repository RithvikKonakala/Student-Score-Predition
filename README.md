Table of content:-
- Student_info - It contain CSV file.
- University - It contain Backend Code.
- Templates - It contain templates.
- Prediction - It contain Fronted(Deployment)
- Predict - It contain pkl file.
- Static - It contain image.

Business Understanding:-
-In this project we built a prediction model for know how many hours a Oxstandhard university students need to learn to get more than 90% marks in his/her examination.

Data Understanding:-
-We have historical data of student who studied for particular hours to get particular score and this attributes are the perfect fit for build our model.

Technologies:- 
- Python
- Sklearn (to build a simple linear regressions model)
- Joblib (it is a pipeline)
- Flask (it is a deployment library)

Setup:-
- Install Anaconda Navigator into your laptop.
- If the 'Joblib' isn't installed in your Spyder, try 'pip install Joblib'.
- If 'Flask' isn't installed in your Spyder, try 'pip install flask'.

Approach:-
- Open Spyder and run the code given in 'University' code file.
- Check out your csv file location and paste it their.
- Train Linear regression model.
- Make sure that you place every file, I given in one folder.
- Now comes to deployment, check out 'Prediction' and run it.

Status:-
Completed

Credits:-
- This project was developed as a practice to known deployment in by our sir Prakesh Senapati, who has a 17 yrs experience. I am very thankful for sir.
